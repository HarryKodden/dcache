The Frontend service is the dCache service (cell) responsible for serving data to clients via HTTP/REST. The default port on which it runs is 3880. The default protocol is https (TLS). As usual, these, as well as other values for timeouts, enabling proxies, and anonymous user access, can be configured; see /usr/share/dcache/defaults/frontend.properties for details.
